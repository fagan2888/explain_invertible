# Introduction
* This repo contains the code to reproduce the results on toy example for the paper [Invertible Network for Classification and
Biomarker Selection for ASD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09729.pdf)
* The basic idea is to use an invertible neural network, and explicitly determine the decision boundary.
* After determining the decision boundary, we can calculate the projection of a data point onto the decision boundary. <br/>
The difference between and point and its projection onto the boundary can be viewed as the explanation for network decision.
